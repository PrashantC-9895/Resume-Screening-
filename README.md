# Resume-Screening using NLP
Resume-Screening using NLP techniques 


Preprocessing: Includes code for text preprocessing tasks such as tokenization, stop word removal, and stemming/lemmatization.
Feature Extraction: Implements methods for extracting relevant features from resumes and job descriptions, such as TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) vectors or word embeddings.
Matching Algorithm: Utilizes NLP algorithms to match candidate resumes with job requirements based on extracted features, considering factors like keyword matching and semantic similarity.
Evaluation Metrics: Provides functions for evaluating the performance of the resume screening model, including metrics such as precision, recall, and F1-score.
Deployment: Includes scripts or guidelines for deploying the trained model in a production environment, either as a standalone application or integrated into existing HR systems.
